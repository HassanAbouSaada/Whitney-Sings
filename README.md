# Introduction

Welcome to Whitney Sings, a fun and exciting game where players can unleash their musical skills and test their reflexes. This game is designed to offer a unique experience that combines music, challenge, and fun in one fantastic package.

The objective of the game is to help Whitney Houston hit the right notes while avoiding the paparazzi and bad press. Each time you hit the falling note specified with its name and octave like C5 for example, you will hear it, which makes the game even more fun and engaging.

# Used technologies

Document Object Model (DOM) was used to display game elements such as player, enemy, and item objects. JavaScript was used to dynamically generate and modify these elements based on the game state. The DOM was also used to handle user input and trigger game events.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was used to make the code modular and easier to maintain, as each object has its own specific responsibilities and can be modified without affecting other parts of the code.
